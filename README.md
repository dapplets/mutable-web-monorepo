# Mutable Web

Mutable Web is a browser extension, that instantly adds insights, new workflows and automated AI agents to someone elseÂ´s websites, improving users' personal productivity, their community experience and overcoming the limitations set by website owners. 

## Use Cases
Here is an example of what is possible:
- When a user visits a website, an AICrawler agent stores the parsed content in storage and prepares it for further analysis and AI training. If the data is used, the user is paid.
- When a user visits a prediction market website, an AI agent highlights markets worth investing in.
- When a user visits a forum website, another AI agent checks posts and discussions for fallacies, validates source links, adds trust ratings, and helps create bets that challenge dubious content.
- Send and receive crypto to and from social accounts.
- Create custom message timelines, even including deleted posts.
- Create web guides to navigate users through complex websites.  

## The Greater Vision 
Mutable Web is completely decentralised, context-aware, permissionless and runs over existing websites without asking the owners for permission. Any user or community can now customise any website on the web. Anyone is free to create applications and agents that process content on websites visited by users and share it within the community.

Communities can now gain control over the UI of the websites they use, creating their own workflows, earning their own money and finally becoming self-sovereign.

Mutable Web is a primary choice for integrating personal AI agents into the websites users visit on the fly.
